## Project Description
This project involves the **design, development, and analysis of an interactive Ecommerce Sales Dashboard using Microsoft Excel**. The objective was to transform raw transactional data into a structured analytical tool that enables stakeholders to **monitor performance, identify trends, and evaluate profitability** across multiple business dimensions.

The dashboard consolidates **sales, profit, order volume, and margin data** into a single view while allowing dynamic exploration through filters.

## Scope of Work
The project covers the **entire analytics workflow**, including:
- Data preparation and validation
- KPI definition and calculation
- Analytical breakdown across time, geography, category, and customer segment
- Dashboard design and interactivity implementation

## Data Preparation & Processing
- Cleaned and standardized raw ecommerce transaction data
- Created calculated fields for:
  - **Total Sales**
  - **Total Profit**
  - **Quantity Sold**
  - **Number of Orders**
  - **Profit Margin (%)**
- Implemented **Year-over-Year (YoY) growth calculations** for key performance indicators
- Ensured consistency in **category, subcategory, region, and state-level** data

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard presents the following KPIs with trend indicators:
- **Total Sales**
- **Total Profit**
- **Total Quantity Sold**
- **Number of Orders**
- **Profit Margin**
- **YoY Growth (%)** for Sales, Profit, Quantity, Orders, and Margin

These KPIs enable quick assessment of overall business health and growth trends.

### 2. Category-Level Analysis
- Category-wise profit comparison (**Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology**)
- Sales share distribution by category
- Evaluation of revenue contribution versus profitability

### 3. Subcategory Performance
- Identification of top 10 subcategories by sales
- Analysis of key revenue drivers and product-level concentration risk

- Enabled dynamic filtering across all visuals and KPIs
- Designed the layout to maintain readability and logical information flow under all filter combinations

## Tools & Techniques Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
  - Slicers for interactivity
  - Calculated fields and measures
  - Conditional formatting for trend indicators
